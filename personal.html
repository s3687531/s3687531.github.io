								<h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h2>
								<p>It's important, both in terms of understanding your professional personality and in terms of
being flexible in a changing world.</p>
								<p>At the same time, it is very difficult for me to know myself. Through the test, I can learn
									about my character strengths and weaknesses in advance during my study, so that I can adapt to the working life more easily in the future.</p>

	
								<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
								<p>Through the personality test, my personality is introversion, sensing, thinking, judgment.
While people with ISTJ personality type tend to be reserved, practical and quiet. By analysing
the specific evaluation in the article, I am more suitable for completing tasks in a team than
leading a team. I am more suitable for working behind the scenes, collaborating with small
teams or completing tasks independently.
</p>
								
								<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
								<p>When forming a team, I should be cheerful, good communication and leadership partners to
join the team, so as to achieve the purpose of complementary personality.</p>
