							<h2>The game development</h2>
							<p>I think anyone choosing an IT project should choose the one they're passionate about, not the one
that's hot right now, because that way you can work with passion and incredible creativity, and
making games is my choice.</p>
                <p>The project in this paper:</p>
                <p>According to the two major game website</p>
                <p>statistical data can be know, in 2007, the first
after the interview, the game market increased by $100 billion in 11 years, the size of the mobile
business rose 25.5%, to $70.3 billion, which means that more than half of the game revenues for the
first time from the mobile terminal. Smartphones will account for 80 percent of that, or $56.4 billion,
with the remaining 20 percent coming from tablets. Console games are the second largest category,
with 2018 revenue of $34.6 billion, while PC games will generate $32.9 billion. Therefore, it can be
judged that with the development and popularization of hardware in the future, the game industry
                  will continue to rise in the future and become one of the mainstream leisure ways of the public.</p>
                <h2>Motivation:</h2>
                <p> In the past ten years, the way of game operation has undergone fundamental changes. From the
single way that game companies make profits by selling games, they have developed into a
                  combination of games and peripheral services.</p>
                <p> The increase of consumers and demand has become the decisive factor of game industry reform.On
the analysis of the factors before, of course, take a look at August 13, 2019 update of the Top 100
                  Countries by Game Revenues ", the Top 10.</p>
                <img src="/images/prc09.PNG" width="711" height="266" />
                <p>No form of entertainment can give players so much passion as games. They can not only actively
participate, but also allow players of different emotions, lifestyles, interests, regions and income
levels to enjoy the fun of games. The viewing experience is definitely one of the core elements, so
almost any new game can be incorporated into a competitive mode that makes it a professional
esports activity. There are also game anchors, professional gamers and professional teams with
                  millions of fans.</p>
                <h2>So what's driving the boom in the game industry?</h2>
                <p>Reason 1: Material needs are fully met
The increase in income has led to the satisfaction of people's basic material needs, and thus began
to pursue spiritual satisfaction, the entire service industry has been developed, and of course the
                  game industry is also.</p>
                <p>Reason 2: The popularity of the universal platform reduces the threshold of the game
Previously playing games required specialized equipment, so the game penetration rate was not
high. The emergence of PCs and smart phones has effectively alleviated this problem, and the
                  popularity of PCs and smartphones has enabled the game to spread effectively.</p>
                <p>Reason 3: Experience to upgrade
Game quality upgrade: from the earliest pixels to the current movie-level quality. Of course, the
                  player is still on the 2D screen.</p>
<p>Higher dimensional experience upgrade: VR : It is a new generation of technology that everyone has
high hopes for. This technology breaks the limitations of the screen experience and truly brings a
                  new experience to a higher dimension. Such as: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsna1ChGt0E</p>
              
               <p> AR: The experience of AR is not the same as VR. VR is a completely immersive experience, but AR has
created a new experience that can incorporate more elements of the real world. Such as:
                 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIHPPtPBgHk&t=69s </p>
                <p>Reason 4: Social experience improvement: The previous games were not connected, but they could
be played or co-operated at the same time. Everyone knows that two people are more interesting
                  than one.</p>
                <p>Current games such as League of Legends, CS:GO or World of Warcraft are multiplayer or
multiplayer games. This also makes the game more interesting.</p>
                <p>Reason 5: Job creation: As mentioned before, people are not satisfied with a single game
experience, but still pursue these tangible things. Therefore, many new jobs have been born around
the game: Cosplay, manual manufacturer of game characters, game anchor, game commentary and so on</p>
                <p>The birth of these new jobs, while helping more people to find jobs, is also promoting the
                  development of the game industry.</p>
                <p>To sum up, the game industry is bound to get better and better, so I choose the game development
                  project</p>
                <p>Tools and Technologies: Unity3D is a multi-platform integrated game development tool developed
by Unity Technologies that allows you to easily create interactive content such as 3D video games,
architectural visualization, real-time 3D animation, etc. It is a fully integrated professional game
                  engine.</p>
                <h2>Skills Required ï¼š I need to involve the following technologies when using Unity3D:</h2>
                <p>C# language foundation</p>
                <p>Unity3D engine foundation</p>
                <p>C# language advanced (introduction to data structure)</p>
                <p>Unity3D interface UI (NGUI)</p>
                <p>Simple complete project example</p>
                <p>Character animation control (animation system, navigation system)</p>
                <p>C# language enhancement (delegation and events, common design patterns)</p>
                <p>Client Core Technology (UGUI, Lua)</p>
                <p>Intermediate project</p>
                <p>AI artificial intelligence</p>
                <p>3D mathematical foundation (vector, Euler angle, quaternion, matrix, etc.)</p>
                <p>Client Resource Management (Editor Extension, Asset Bundle)</p>
                

							<p>Outcome: If the project is successful, it will provide a new game for the market, and promote the
emergence of new players. If the game is big, then an industry chain and big IP will be born. Thereby
indirectly promoting the development of the game market.</p>
